## 📌 Problem Statement

*WS-01: Menstrual Hygiene Infrastructure in Educational Institutions*

Many campuses lack adequate menstrual hygiene support—stocked dispensers, clean restrooms, disposal bins, and responsive policies. Students face discomfort and poor hygiene, while administrators lack visibility into on-ground conditions. There's no standardized or anonymous system to monitor, report, or improve these facilities.
