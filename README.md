Problem Statement 
Educational institutions often lack adequate menstrual hygiene infrastructure, 
including stocked dispensers, clean restrooms, proper disposal bins, and supportive 
policies. Students face discomfort and poor hygiene, while administrators lack 
visibility into on-ground conditions and issues go unreported or unresolved. There is 
currently no standardized or anonymous system to monitor, report, or improve 
menstrual support facilities on campuses.
